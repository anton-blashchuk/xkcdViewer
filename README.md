My work on https://github.com/shortcut/coding-assignment-mobile . <br>
This is still a work-in-progress due to lack of spare time for it. At current stage this is somewhere between PoC and MVP - need more testing and error handling
<br>
#### What is done:
  1. Basic MVVM/Clean architecture
  2. Loading Comics
  3. Navigating forward/backward/random
  4. Zoom/pan functionality

#### What needs to be done:

  1. Shift to DI
  2. add Tests
  3. add handling of negative scenarios or errors
  4. finish implementing "Favorite" functionality (only DB is ready now)
  5. comics` details, explanations, search
