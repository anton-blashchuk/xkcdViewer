My work on https://github.com/shortcut/coding-assignment-mobile .
This is still a work-in-progress because it was too hard to manage life circumstances and give the project more time. At current stage this is somewhere between PoC and MVP - need more testing and error handling

What is done:
  Basic MVVM/Clean architecture
  Loading Comics
  Navigating forward/backward/random
  Zoom/pan functionality

What needs to be done:
  Shift to DI
  add Tests
  add handling of negative scenarios or errors
  finish implementing "Favorite" functionality (only DB is ready now)
  comics` details, explanations, search
